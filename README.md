This code simulates fluid flow in a pipe to analyze flow characteristics, calculating the Reynolds number to identify the flow regime (laminar or turbulent) and determining the friction factor accordingly.
<br>

It computes the entrance length needed for fully developed flow and calculates the velocity profile across the pipe's radius. 
<br>

Using the Darcy-Weisbach equation, it then calculates pressure drops along varying pipe lengths, outputting key parameters like entrance length, Reynolds number, flow regime, and friction factor. 
<br>

Finally, it visualizes the velocity profile and pressure drop along the pipe length, indicating the entrance length for fully developed flow.
